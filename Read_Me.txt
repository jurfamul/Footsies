Footsies AI instructions:
To demo the results of the AI training, please open the unity editor, select window and then select build.
This will build a complete version of the game that allows the user to select either 2 player mode or vs AI. 
Both modes utilize the new AI agent asthe first Player. So two players allow the user to control player 2 and fight the agent.
While vsAI will have the agent fight the preprogramed AI. The current model is based on the 
last training session with 2 million eposodes.

If you wish to run the AI training:
Open the unity editor
open a python window, note: must be python version 3.8
pip install mlagents
then simply run mlagents-learn and press start in the unity editor.
